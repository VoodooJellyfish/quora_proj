    answer: "My 9 year old son hitted puberty I didn't know he was an adult lesson and I walk in one day caught him shaving his armpits I go when did you get armpit hair he goes a few months ago but before I said that I was shoch going what are you doing and notice some hair I told him don't shave in your room you're going to make a mess and go do it in the bathroom sink also son you didn't have to tell me you hitted puberty because I know it's an embarrassing conversation but now I know why for the past few months you've been acting just be glad you're an early bloomer son now I was a late bloomer and it suck going to high school and hadn't even hit puberty yet so you should be glad early but remember son you're 9 so don't be doing teenage things when most people haven't hitted puberty even many girls haven't in your class either, my son goes don't worry to much you won't have to worry until I'm almost 12 because middle school and elementary school is a big difference, I also told him the two most important things make sure you show down there and you pits you don't have to worry about anything else because men are hairy he agreed. Some men don't shave their armpits I understand but if it sweats stink and not that attractive as it seems if it was women would grow it out but most don't like wise you should get rid of that. Make sure get rid of pubs and armpits and that was it, it's now been 2 years later my son is 11 he has just graduated elementary school got out of 5th grade, he now has hair everywhere now but shaves daily with pubs and armpits but leaves everything else he try getting rid of his back hair but we told him no because the back just going to grow back I know it may be uncomfortable but you still have to grow it out because it's natural for men to have it. He accepts now he hairy he has shave a few times but now regrets it he relise men are hairy and it's better that way men should never imitate women. It may itch his back but it's fault for shaving it but he learnt he lesson.",

    answer: `I have a single parent friend who was in the same situation with her 19 year old son, who was not working and was behaving badly. She told him he had to go to work and pay a modest amount of rent, or be going to school, otherwise he'd have to leave. Problem is, he refused to do any of those things and she wasn't physically able to enforce it and remove him.

She figured out a solution, although it's drastic. She paid $95 for new locks and keys, and didn't give him a key. Every morning when she left for work, he had to leave too, and go somewhere. When she got home she'd let him back in and he could sleep there. In other words, he had a place to sleep and eat dinner, but not much more. He wasn't allowed to be there unless she was there.

This worked for a few days, but at one point he decided she couldn't make him leave in the morning, and he didn't care if she had to get to work, he was going to continue sleeping. ("What are you gonna do about it?") So she called the Police, explained the situation, and asked for their help escorting him out.

When the Police showed up, he was so embarrassed, he left that day without much hassle. After that, he knew she meant business. She told him she would continue this for 2 more weeks, after which time she would keep the door locked and he would not be allowed to stay there at all unless he had a job and started paying rent.

It worked. He got a job at a fast food restaurant, then later at a grocery store (got a small raise with that move), and eventually decided he wanted to further his education. (There's nothing like working low-wage jobs to get you motivated to learn and gain better skills!)

He ended up going to trade school to learn HVAC and after working in that field for a while, is considering starting his own business. (And yes, he did move out after he was working steadily.) He realizes now what a huge favor his mother did for him. But I'm sure it wasn't easy or pleasant for her at the time. I give her huge props!!`,

    answer: 'This dealer is out to screw you. Here’s how it works. You agree to take the car back and let them pull the rims and tires and put stock ones on. You get there, hand them the keys, they drive the vehicle out of sight - and then it starts. The sales manager, or maybe the finance guy, comes out with a song-and-dance about how they undercharged you for the car, boo-hoo, poor them - and of *course* you don’t want to be *unfair* to the poor little car dealer, he’s gonna lose his job, wah-wah-wah, so he’ll just tear up that mean old contract and you can sign a new one for more money, yay!',

    answer: 'This is a classic scam of dealerships although I have not heard this variation. When it was pulled on me years ago I was told the finance person needed to go over some things with me. So I went up to the dealership all unsuspecting and naive. They told me I needed to pay $40 more a month. I said, “we had a deal, now we don’t “. They sputtered something about working something out I said, “where’s my car, my Mazda? Bring me my car now”. They tried to say they had already sent my trade-in to auction, I said, “bring it to me now or I’m calling my lawyer.” Within 10 minutes I had my down payment and my Mazda and was on my way. This was Landmark Chevrolet on the North Freeway, Houston, Texas. They have been out of business for years.',

My son was at home when it arrived, and I had told him to call me when it got there, and I would come home to help him get it in the house. By the time I got there, he had moved it into the house, and moved the old one into the kitchen so it would be easier to move out. He had even brought down the vacuum cleaner from upstairs and vacuumed where the old love seat had been, without me ever having mentioned it needing to be done. I was absolutely blown away.',

    answer: 'In 2016, I lost my 10 year old daughter to sepsis from a bacterial infection. It took me about 6 months to clean out her room. I could no longer live in the home that I raised the child that I just lost. This was around the time “Musically”, now known as “TicTok” was popular with tweens. Might I add, my daughter was an old soul and mature beyond her years. I found a homemade “selfie stick”, and attached to that was a tablet that I thought I had misplaced. Upon going through this tablet, I found several videos of my daughter singing and dancing. I have videos of her precious voice that I can listen to whenever i want to. I can’t bring myself to watch them yet but I know they are there when I am able to. It was a priceless gift that I will cherish as long as I live. I’m stingy with these videos, I feel privileged to have them.',

    answer: `Early in my career a rich international family got a girl without any money or family to date their son and get pregnant. Dad was a doctor and doped her and kept her prisoner in his home. He had security that would not let her leave. Grandma tried to poison her. GM wanted to raise the baby herself. In Texas, there was no way to stop dad from having parental rights.

During this time, there was a lot of tv and magazine info regarding helping women and their children escape abusive relationship by going into “the underground”.

She asked me about the underground. I’d never heard of it. I did some research. Once she entered this underground network she could never leave or else she’d be arrested for violating a judge’s order. The lady was truly afraid for her life. I agreed with her that her life was in danger.

I met dad and his family. They were truly horrible people that thought because they were so wealthy that they did not have to follow any rules. Grandma was particularly nasty and threatening to me and my staff. They had many ties overseas to countries that only give men custody. Since dad was a doctor he could leave the US and work anywhere.

Mom and baby disappeared. I have no idea what happened to them. Dad won legal custody.

Several years later I received a Christmas card with no return address and no name. It said - “we are safe & I thank you for all you did for us”.`,

    answer: "Did she explain WHY she wanted a Macbook Pro and not a Macbook Air? There was clearly a lack of communication in this situation. I know it’s easy to call someone unappreciative, entitled, and a spoiled brat in cases like this. However, I will not make that assumption since I don’t know what happened with your daughter. The best thing to do would have been to not buy her anything until there was an agreement on what was affordable and suitable.",

    answer: 'I can say my prison life was productive…I served 23 years in a medium security federal prison but was placed in the high security area due to an escape / failure to self surrender on time. I self taught myself basic math all the way up thru masters level math. Same with finance and accounting. I became a self-proclaimed historian and I literally read hundreds and hundreds of history books about the American Revolution, Civil War and both WW’s. I studied and learned about the British royalty and family and what it was all about. I taught myself the German language. I wrote to dozens of grade and high schools, colleges and universities for donations of text books and reading materials and the outpouring of support was enormous. It was great publicity for the warden and associate warden so of course they embraced it. I read a lot of literary novels from authors like Hemingway, Dickens. Red Harry Potter novels as well. Read my bible cover to cover hundreds of times during my incarceration. I became a model inmate, I followed rules to a tee and did not put myself in any position for trouble. I was the main cell house orderly for over 13 years which enabled me to move about the cell house to deliver and pickup laundry, mail, cleaning / hygene supplies and books as I became the main librarian at the prison. I also worked at Unicor. I worked out and exercised daily, learned how to play chess, pinnacle, spades, hearts, euchre.',

Once there was a family who knocked on the door of our home every night during dinner saying. “hey can we eat? My wife is to tired to cook"

We were being nice and letting them eat dinner with us everynight for about a week. Then the excuse got old.

So one night after dinner he put all the plates on the floor and let the dogs lick them clean, and put them back into the cabinets.

The couple and there family were surprised and asked if they did that every night. He told them yes. Why waste the water.

They left and never came back.`,
